# The "Boléro" Re-Scored Project

## Introduction

This project aims to create a complete transcription of Maurice Ravel's "Boléro" using a self-designed, unconventional notation system. The goal is to explore how visual elements can represent musical parameters beyond traditional staff notation, focusing on the unique structural and textural characteristics of "Boléro".

## Why "Boléro"?

Ravel's "Boléro" is in the public domain and features a clear, repetitive structure with a single, unchanging melodic theme and a continuous crescendo. This makes it an ideal canvas for experimenting with how dynamics, repetition, and orchestration can be represented visually without traditional staff lines.

## Notation System Goals

The notation system developed in this project will prioritize the following aspects of the music:

- **Rhythm:** Represent the persistent snare drum ostinato and rhythmic patterns through visual repetition, spacing, and geometric shapes.
- **Texture:** Illustrate the layering of instruments and the gradual thickening of the orchestral texture using overlapping fields, transparency, and density of marks.
- **Dynamics:** Depict the continuous crescendo (from pianissimo to fortissimo) through changes in color saturation, line thickness, and visual intensity.
- **Timbre:** Differentiate between instrument families (woodwinds, brass, strings, percussion) via distinct symbolic vocabularies—color coding, iconography, or texture patterns.
- **Form:** Make the repetitive yet evolving structure immediately visible through cyclical layouts, progressive transformations, and cumulative visual elements.

## Project Structure

This repository will contain:

- Graphic score files (SVG/PNG) for each section of the piece.
- Documentation of the notation system and design decisions.
- A complete final score assembled from all sections.
- Issue tracking and pull requests that document the entire creative process.

## Workflow

We will follow a structured GitHub workflow:
1. **Repository Setup** – This README and initial planning.
2. **Project Planning with Issues** – Breaking the piece into logical sections and creating labeled issues.
3. **Feature Development with Branches and Pull Requests** – Creating notation for each section, reviewing, and merging.
4. **Final Release** – Compiling all sections into a complete score and publishing a versioned release.
